A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the

# BUG: this returns 289982, which is 538*539. But this method of 
# zipping through these pairs of numbers does not produce largest.
# For ex, if 999*997 were a palindrome, it would of course be larger.

# New approach...must need to calc many pair-mults, check palindrome,
# keep largest. But how many pairs do I need to mult and check?
